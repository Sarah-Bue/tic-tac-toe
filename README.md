## User Experience (UX)
### Project Goals

### User Stories

### Color Scheme
![Color Scheme Image](assets/readme-files/palette.png)
The body of the website uses an off-white color (#E2E6EA - Anti-Flash White), combined with a medium gray color (#475B63 - Payne's Gray) for the main area.

The board itself uses a brown-gray color (#986C6A - Rose Taupe), with player marks and grids displaying in the off-white color of the body.

Win / Draw announcements are displayed in a brighter, orance color (#FFB140 - Orange (web)).

### Typography
![Type Font Image](assets/readme-files/font.png)
The site uses Gloria Hallelujah, imported from Google Fonts, as its main font.

The fallback font, in case Gloria Hallelujah isn't loaded correctly, is Sans Serif.
